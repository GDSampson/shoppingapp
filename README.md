# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

1.
   ```bash
   npm run reset-project
   ```

   This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

2.
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   ```
   This will install a dev tools like expo go's interface

3.
   ```bash
   npx expo install prebuild -p android
   ```
   This will generate a folder with the specified platform (-p [android]) folder containing the native files necessary for deployment. You may also omit a platform specification and the -p option to prebuild for both platforms

4.
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android
   ```
   This will build and run the app (using the generated native files with the command above) on an emulator. You can add the --device option to run the app on a connected physical device. 
   
These commands run the same way if you replace android with ios.
